Umoji is a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program project. The purpose of the project is to take an image and convert it to an "emoji" by applying filters and cropping. Our goal is to have the image saved into a photo library so that users can send it to other people via social media apps. 

The following section of code includes the use of css classes for filters on images. We used jquery and html for the buttons.

<!--$(document).ready(function(){
        $("#button").click(function(){
        $("#imgID").removeClass();
        $("#imgID").addClass("sepia");
        });
    
        $("#button2").click(function(){
            $("#imgID").removeClass();
        $("#imgID").addClass("saturate");
        });

<button class= "button" id="button"  >Sepia</button>
<button class= "button" id="button2" >Saturate</button>-->

We wanted to create this app because of the carefree and hilarious nature it brings along with its features. Umoji fixes the problems of dullness in everyday routines and gives inidividuals opportunities to decorate their favorite pictures. Other featuring pages such as the Jokemoji, Catmoji, and Mememoji are for the users' entertainment when they simply want to relax and cherish these arts. We exist to create, and UMoji exists to lend users' a chance to make their own Mojis.

To use the project, install the ZIP file. Access to all html, css, and javascript files are in the "www" folder. CSS and JavaScript files are in their respective folders within "www".
